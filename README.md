# cola

A software suite made by a group of friends to play DND together in optimal condition.

Subprojects should include:
- a client to display maps and spells and characters live
- a peer-to-peer library to share assets
- a DM toolbox/adminpanel to automate needed computations and overlook the game
- maybe a messaging system? 
- whatever you guys think we may need!

All technologies are allowed, and any contribution is welcome!
